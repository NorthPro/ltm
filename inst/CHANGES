Changes in version: ltm_0.3-0

  o a new logical argument -- 'IRT.parm' (default to FALSE) -- has been introduced in both "ltm()" and "rasch()"
    which if TRUE reports the coefficients under the usual IRT parameterization.

  o "plot.ltm()" and "plot.rasch()" improved: (i) if the column names of the input data are not NULL then they are 
    used to denote the items, (ii) printing of legend is now optional -- see argument 'legend', (iii) if 'legend = FALSE',
    'text()' is used to add as labels to the existing plot either the column names of the input data or numbers denoting
    the items, (iv) there is an argument 'items' controlling which items are plotted.

  o 'constraint' argument in "ltm()" accepts now more general fixed value constraints. For more info check 
    help("ltm", package = "ltm").

  o a "fitted()" method has been introduced for both classes 'ltm' and 'rasch'.

  o a "logLik()" method has been introduced for both classes 'ltm' and 'rasch'.

  o a "vcov()" method has been introduced for both classes 'ltm' and 'rasch'.

  o now robust standard errors estimation is done inside "vcov.rasch()" and "vcov.ltm()".

  o "coef.ltm()" and "coef.rasch" have a new logical argument 'prob' which if TRUE, then the probabilities
    of a positive response for the median individual are returned.

  o "descript()" now has a print method -- 'print' argument no longer available.

==============================

Changes in version: ltm_0.2-1

  o "rasch()" now contains an extra argument 'constraint' that permits incorporation of fixed-value constraints. 
    For more info check help("rasch", package = "ltm").

  o "anova.rasch()" now also performs LRTs between constrained and unconstrained Rasch models.
  
  o a "vcov()" method has been introduced for "rasch()" objects.

  o Edited *.Rd files to use \method{} for generics.

  o corrected some typos in .Rd files.
